Benefits of using OOP in Python
1. Helps manage complexity
2. Can create containers for data that can be isolated without affecting entire program.
3. Build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code.
4. Creating classes and objects allow programmers to think at a more abstract level.
5. programmers can write code that can be used with different kinds of data.
6. easier to conceptualize structure of a program with nouns and verbs.
7. can section off areas of code that perform specific procedures, removes dependencies.
